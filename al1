Architectures and Libraries
---------------------------

AL5. What target would you use in debian/rules to build a .deb
     package which includes only non-architecture-dependent files?
     What is the "Architecture:" field for this package?

AL7. Why does a libfoo-dev package depend on libfooX?
     Why is it libfooX-dev and not libfoo-dev in some cases?
     (When) is libfooX-dev preferable over libfoo-dev?

ALA. What are debian/*.symbols files? How are they maintained?
ALC. What are the special steps one must take when upgrading a
     package that previously contained libfooX.so.N and now contains
     libfooX.so.N+1? What if the library filename remains the same,
     but users report that programs depending on your library now
     stop working with the new version?
