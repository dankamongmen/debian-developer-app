Package Building and Uploading
------------------------------

BU1. How do you manage new upstream releases?

BU1a. I'm unsure of the scope of this question. There's the question of "how
      do you stay aware of new upstream releases?" and also "how do you ingest
      a new upstream release?" Both seem sufficiently open-ended as to require
      only a personal statement, but feel free to ask me to expand on either
      topic.

      I am the upstream author of all my Debian packages thus far. For
      packages I were to maintain without authoring, I would subscribe to the
      relevant mailing lists, RSS feeds, etc. The Debian Package Tracker,
      among other tools, can be configured to alert me when the packaged
      version is eclipsed by uscan(1) results.

      As for ingestion of new versions, I use gbp(1)'s standard workflow.
      As an example, I have a script "debrelease.sh" in my Notcurses source,
      which is kept (along with Debian packaging materials) in salsa:

      [0] https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/master/tools/debrelease.sh
      [1] https://salsa.debian.org/debian/notcurses

      When I cut a new release, I run that from within a Salsa checkout. It
      performs:

      * uscan --repack --compression xz --force
      * dch
      * gpg --sign --armor --detach-sign ../notcurses_$VERSION+dfsg.1.orig.tar.xz
      * upload of the DFSGified sources to github
      * gbp-import-orig
      * salsa push
      * dpkg-buildpackage --build=source
      * pbuilder build

      If this all succeeds, I upload to unstable with dput.

BU5. If you want to sponsor a package upload, what do you need to do?
     Please take a random package from the archive and send me the
     .changes file as it would look if you were sponsoring an upload of
     this package.

BU6. How do you upload a package to
     - unstable
     - stable / stable-proposed-updates (is there a difference?)
     - the DELAYED queue

BU7. What do you do if you've uploaded broken or incomplete files to
     the upload queue (something that can easily happen if your Internet
     connection is not stable, for example)?

BU8. What is a source-only upload? How do you prepare a source-only
     upload? Please explain to me about potential advantages and
     disadvantages of such upload type. Please also explain why you
     should do binary uploads to NEW queue and source-only uploads in
     most common cases.
