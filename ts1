If you have filed bugreports (with patches) to the BTS with respect to
packaging issues, please tell me bug numbers, so I can check them.
                                                                                                                                    
PP4. If one of your packages had serious problems like either
       a) the current version in the archive is not "mature" enough
          to be in a Debian release but it is developing and you still
          want to maintain it
       b) the software was abandoned upstream or became obsolete for
          other reasons and you consider it not worth including in
          Debian.
      How would you proceed in these cases?

PP9. What would you do if a package has no sane default configuration?
     Suppose that it is impossible to create a default configuration that
     works on most systems.

PPc. The devscripts package contains many tools to help you with
     packaging.  You can learn more about the available commands in the
     file /usr/share/doc/devscripts/README.gz or alternatively by running
     "apt-cache show devscripts".  Some of them you might already be
     familiar with, like dget, debuild, dch or debclean, but there are a
          many more that could prove useful.  Try testing some of them, reading
     their manpages or, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
     Let me know what some of your favourites are and why.

PPd. Build one of your packages using:

       debuild 2>/dev/null | grep dh_ | shuf | head -1

     (substitute debuild for your favourite build command) and try to
     tell me what that debhelper command is supposed to do.

Package Building and Uploading
------------------------------

BU1. How do you manage new upstream releases?

BU5. If you want to sponsor a package upload, what do you need to do?
     Please take a random package from the archive and send me the
     .changes file as it would look if you were sponsoring an upload of
     this package.

BU6. How do you upload a package to
     - unstable
     - stable / stable-proposed-updates (is there a difference?)
     - the DELAYED queue

BU7. What do you do if you've uploaded broken or incomplete files to
     the upload queue (something that can easily happen if your Internet
     connection is not stable, for example)?

BU8. What is a source-only upload? How do you prepare a source-only
     upload? Please explain to me about potential advantages and
     disadvantages of such upload type. Please also explain why you
     should do binary uploads to NEW queue and source-only uploads in
     most common cases.

Architectures and Libraries
---------------------------

AL5. What target would you use in debian/rules to build a .deb
     package which includes only non-architecture-dependent files?
     What is the "Architecture:" field for this package?

AL7. Why does a libfoo-dev package depend on libfooX?
     Why is it libfooX-dev and not libfoo-dev in some cases?
     (When) is libfooX-dev preferable over libfoo-dev?

ALA. What are debian/*.symbols files? How are they maintained?
ALC. What are the special steps one must take when upgrading a
     package that previously contained libfooX.so.N and now contains
     libfooX.so.N+1? What if the library filename remains the same,
     but users report that programs depending on your library now
     stop working with the new version?
