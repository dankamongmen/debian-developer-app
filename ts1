If you have filed bugreports (with patches) to the BTS with respect to
packaging issues, please tell me bug numbers, so I can check them.
                                                                                                                                    
PP4. If one of your packages had serious problems like either
       a) the current version in the archive is not "mature" enough
          to be in a Debian release but it is developing and you still
          want to maintain it
       b) the software was abandoned upstream or became obsolete for
          other reasons and you consider it not worth including in
          Debian.
      How would you proceed in these cases?

PP9. What would you do if a package has no sane default configuration?
     Suppose that it is impossible to create a default configuration that
     works on most systems.

PPc. The devscripts package contains many tools to help you with
     packaging.  You can learn more about the available commands in the
     file /usr/share/doc/devscripts/README.gz or alternatively by running
     "apt-cache show devscripts".  Some of them you might already be
     familiar with, like dget, debuild, dch or debclean, but there are a
          many more that could prove useful.  Try testing some of them, reading
     their manpages or, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
     Let me know what some of your favourites are and why.

PPd. Build one of your packages using:

       debuild 2>/dev/null | grep dh_ | shuf | head -1

     (substitute debuild for your favourite build command) and try to
     tell me what that debhelper command is supposed to do.
