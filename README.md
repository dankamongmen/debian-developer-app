# Endankifying Debian

I applied to become a Debian Developer with full uploading privileges in
September 2021, having been advocated by Philipp Kern.

At that time, I had been using Debian for about twenty years, had been
uploading under sponsorship for a little over a year, and had been a Debian
Maintainer for about six months. I had overseen my own Debian Derivative,
"SprezzOS", for two years (2012–2013). I had created and maintained dozens of
DEB packages professionally and for open source outside of Debian,
preparing and administrating close a handful of [repropro](https://salsa.debian.org/brlink/reprepro)
instances. I had spent two years on Google's internal "Goobuntu" Linux team.
I had filed (and oftentimes submitted patches for) [many Debian bugs](https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=Debian).
I had spoken at FOSDEM and Debconf, and had patches accepted in over
one hundred open source projects. Developer status is not extended to
Linux novices.

I was appointed Sebastian Ramacher as my Application Manager. I had
previously interacted with Mr. Ramacher during the Notcurses ABI1->ABI2
transition, though that did not come up (nor was it expected to) during
my DD application.

The process of applying to become a Debian Member is described in
[Developers Reference 2](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/new-maintainer.html).
You'll want to be familiar with the [New Members Corner](https://www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint).
Becoming a DD is a lengthy process, and requires active involvement
from existing Developers. You'll generally first need to get some
packages Sponsored via the mentoring system; this will expose you as a
candidate member to the Project. At this stage, all uploads must be made by a
sponsor. Becoming a Debian Maintainer is fairly trivial once a Developer is
willing to nominate you, and allows you to perform your own uploads to a
limited set of packages. A Debian Developer with full uploading privileges has
full write access to the archive, and requires clearing a correspondingly
higher bar (this bar is raised over time).

This repository holds my answers to the DD interview questions. While the
questions are supposedly tailored to the applicant, they seemed to be
pretty much direct copies of the templates at [salsa](https://salsa.debian.org/nm-team/nm-templates/-/tree/master),
most of them unchanged for several years. It is thus likely that these
answers will come up in future DD applications. I ask that you do not
blindly copy them into your application; doing so subverts the intent and
process. With that said, (almost) all materials of the Debian Project are open,
and I see little reason to hide these. There are no secrets contained
herein.
