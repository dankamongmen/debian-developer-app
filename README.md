I applied to become a Debian Developer with full uploading privileges in
September 2021, having been advocated by Philipp Kern. At that time, I had
been using Debian for about twenty years, had been uploading under
sponsorship for a little over a year, and had been a Debian Maintainer
for about six months.

I was appointed Sebastian Ramacher as my Application Manager. I had
previously interacted with Mr. Ramacher during the Notcurses ABI1->ABI2
transition, though that did not come up (nor was it expected to) during
my DD application.

This repository holds my answers to the DD interview questions. While the
questions are supposedly tailored to the applicant, they seemed to be
pretty much direct copies of the templates at [salsa](https://salsa.debian.org/nm-team/nm-templates/-/tree/master),
most of them unchanged for several years. It is thus likely that these
answers will come up in future DD applications. I ask that you do not
blindly copy them into your application; doing so subverts the intent and
process. With that said, (almost) all materials of the Debian Project are open,
and I see little reason to hide these. There are no secrets contained
herein.
